# Observer Pattern Overview

## Introduction

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
When one object (subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.
It is primarily used to implement distributed event handling systems.

    class Subject {
        +Attach(observer: Observer)
        +Detach(observer: Observer)
        +Notify()
    }

    class Observer {
        +Update()
    }

    class ConcreteSubject {
        +GetState(): StateType
        +SetState(state: StateType)
    }

    class ConcreteObserver {
        -subject: ConcreteSubject
        -observerState: StateType
        +Update()
    }

    Subject <|-- ConcreteSubject
    Observer <|-- ConcreteObserver
    ConcreteSubject o--> ConcreteObserver : notifies
```

## Components

* **Subject**: It knows its observers and provides an interface for attaching, detaching, or notifying observers.
* **Observer**: Defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a subject.
* **ConcreteSubject**: Stores the state of interest to ConcreteObserver objects. Sends a notification to its observers when its state changes.
* **ConcreteObserver**: Maintains a reference to a ConcreteSubject object. Implements the Observer updating interface to keep its state consistent with the subject's.

## Usage Scenarios

* When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other.
Encapsulating these aspects in separate objects allows them to vary and evolve independently.
* When a change to one object requires changing others, but you donâ€™t know how many objects need to be changed.
* When an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.

## Best Practices

* Consider using a mediator object if multiple subjects need to be observed, to reduce direct connections between subjects and observers.
* Be cautious about the order of notification, as one observer's update method might affect another.
* When adding and removing observers, ensure thread safety if applicable.
