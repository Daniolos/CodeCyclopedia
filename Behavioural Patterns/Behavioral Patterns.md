# Behavioural Patterns

[[Strategy]]: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

[[Observer]]: Allows an object to publish changes to its state so other objects can react accordingly.

[[Command]]: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization, queuing of requests, and logging of the operations.

[[Iterator]]: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

[[Mediator]]: Encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

[[Memento]]: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

[[State]]: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

[[Template Method]]: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method in an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.

[[Visitor]]: Adds further operations to objects without having to modify them.
