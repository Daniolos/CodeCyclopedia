# Memento Pattern Overview

## Introduction

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for the ability to restore an object to its previous state, which can be useful for features like undo mechanisms.
It primarily involves three roles: Originator, Caretaker, and Memento.

    class Originator {
        +SetState(state: String): void
        +GetState(): String
        +CreateMemento(): Memento
        +RestoreMemento(memento: Memento): void
    }

    class Memento {
        -state: String
        +Memento(state: String)
        +GetState(): String
    }

    class Caretaker {
        -mementos: List[Memento]
        +AddMemento(memento: Memento): void
        +GetMemento(index: int): Memento
    }

    Originator --> Memento : creates
    Caretaker --> Memento : stores
```

## Components

* **Originator**: The object that knows how to save its internal state and restore it from a memento.
* **Memento**: A value object that stores the internal state of the Originator.
It should not be modified once it's created.
* **Caretaker**: Responsible for keeping track of the mementos but never modifies or even looks at the internal state of the mementos.

## Usage Scenarios

* When you need to implement an undo mechanism or restore functionality to previous states.
* When the internal state of an object must be saved externally without exposing its implementation.
* When encapsulation boundaries have to be preserved.

## Best Practices

* Ensure that only the Originator has access to the Mementoâ€™s internal state.
* Mementos should be stored and retrieved by the Caretaker, but the Caretaker should never operate on or examine the contents of a Memento.
* Memento can be made more generic to support various states if needed.
