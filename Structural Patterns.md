# Structural Patterns

[[Adapter]]: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

[[Bridge]]: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

[[Composite]]: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

[[Decorator]]: Adds new functionality to an object without altering its structure.

[[Facade]]: Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

[[Flyweight]]: Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.

[[Proxy]]: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.
